# HumanActionRecognition - Human Action Recognition Project

Welcome to HumanActionRecognition, a project focused on human action recognition using the UCF101 dataset. In this project, I implemented two action recognition models(LRCN and Transformer based fine-tuning) to classify various human activities. Additionally, I conducted a thorough literature review on action recognition models and its applications.


## Introduction
HumanActionRecognition was created as CIS6050: a course project to explore knowledge about the solution for human action recognition. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to classify different actions from videos in the UCF101 dataset.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Implementation of two action recognition models
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictive analysis on new video data
- Visualization of results

## Dataset
The UCF101 dataset is a collection of videos that consists of 101 action categories, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a widely used benchmark for action recognition models. [Link to the dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)
